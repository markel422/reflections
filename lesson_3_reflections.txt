When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would use it if I'm confident enough for it to be shared and edited publicly through the website.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It gives developers the option to choose what state of the files to pull from to checkout its state of a project, such as to see bugs.
