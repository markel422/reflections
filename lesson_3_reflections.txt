When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would use it if I'm confident enough for it to be shared and edited publicly through the website.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It gives developers the option to choose what state of the files to pull from to checkout its state of a project, such as to see bugs.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
I would use forks if I want to clone only within GitHub, use clone if I'm looking to clone only locally to my computer, and use branch if I want to change a commit without actually changing the main branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So that if a pull were to occur, the developer would have to option to view the conflicted file from both new additions and old changes.
